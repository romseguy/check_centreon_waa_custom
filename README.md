You can configure Centreon to use this plugin so you're able to:

* run Selenium tests according to `scenario.html`
* report back the response time between each testing step to Centreon
* trigger alerts whenever a response time exceeds a treshold defined in `scenario.xml`

Fork of the official [Centreon WAA](https://download.centreon.com/?tab=Modules#centreon-waa) plugin.
