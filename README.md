You can configure Centreon to use this plugin so you're able to:

* run a Selenium test according to its HTML specification
* report back the response time between each testing step to Centreon

It's a fork of the official [Centreon WAA](https://download.centreon.com/?tab=Modules#centreon-waa) plugin.
